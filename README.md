# taskSchedule

// The goal is to create a task management system that runs efficiently and stores tasks 
// in a MongoDB database to prevent data loss in case of server restarts. Each task should 
// include a name, date, callback function, and function parameters. When the date of a 
// task arrives, it should be completed promptly. To accomplish this, we will create two 
// simple callback functions, "sendMail" and "doPayment". The implementation should 
// prioritize speed and efficiency.
